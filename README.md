# Rice-leaf-disease-detection

This project provides a solution for automated detection and classification of diseases affecting rice plants using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It includes source code for the backend using FastAPI and TensorFlow, as well as a PyQT-based frontend for user interaction.

## Features

Automatic detection and classification of rice leaf diseases Pretrained deep learning model for accurate predictions User-friendly frontend using PyQT for capturing and uploading leaf images Real-time disease predictions with confidence scores

## Installation
Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/kavinkunarkavin/rice-leaf-disease-detection.git

Install the required dependencies.

Start the backend server: python backend.py.

Launch the frontend application: Run the PyQT applicatation python frontend.py.

## Usage
Open the frontend application. Capture or upload an image of a rice leaf. Click the "Predict" button to initiate disease detection. View the predicted class and confidence score for the detected disease.
